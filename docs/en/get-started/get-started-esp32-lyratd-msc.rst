Overview
^^^^^^^^

The ESP32-LyraTD-MSC V2.2 is an audio development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_ built around ESP32. It is intended for smart speakers and AI applications, by providing hardware for digital signal processing, microphone array and additional RAM on top of what is already onboard of the ESP32 chip. 

This audio development board consists of two parts: the upper board (B), which provides a three-microphone array, function keys and LED lights; and the lower board (A), which integrates ESP32-WROVER-B, a MicroSemi Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, and a power management module.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^

The following list and figure describe key components, interfaces and controls of the ESP32-LyraTD-MSC used in this guide. This covers just what is needed now. For additional details please refer to schematics provided in `Related Documents`_.

ESP32-WROVER-B Module
    The ESP32-WROVER-B module contains ESP32 chip to provide Wi-Fi / BT connectivity and data processing power as well as integrates 32 Mbit SPI flash and 64 Mbit PSRAM for flexible data storage.
DSP Chip
    The Digital Signal Processing chip `ZL38063 <https://www.microsemi.com/document-portal/doc_download/136798-zl38063-datasheet>`_ is used for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications. It captures audio data from an external microphone array and outputs audio signals through its Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC) port.
Headphone Output
    Output socket to connect headphones with a 3.5 mm stereo jack.

    .. note::

        The socket may be used with mobile phone headsets and is compatible with OMPT standard headsets only. It does work with CTIA headsets. Please refer to `Phone connector (audio) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#TRRS_standards>`_ on Wikipedia.

Left Speaker Output
    Output socket to connect 4 ohm speaker. The pins have a standard 2.54 mm / 0.1" pitch.
Right Speaker Output
    Output socket to connect 4 ohm speaker. The pins have a standard 2.54 mm / 0.1" pitch.

    ESP32-LyraTD-MSC V2.2 Lower Board (A) Components

USB-UART Port
    Functions as the communication interface between a PC and the ESP32 WROVER module.
USB Power Port
    Provides the power supply for the board.
Standby / Charging LEDs
    The **Standby** green LED indicates that power has been applied to the **Micro USB Port**. The **Charging** red LED indicates that a battery connected to the **Battery Socket** is being charged.
Power Switch
    Power on/off knob: toggling it right powers the board on; otherwise powers the board off.
Power On LED
    Red LED indicating that **Power Switch** is turned on.

Boot/Reset Buttons
    Boot: holding down the **Boot** button and momentarily pressing the **Reset** button initiates the firmware upload mode. Then user can upload firmware through the serial port. 

    Reset: pressing this button alone resets the system.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up the ESP32-LyraTD-MSC, please make sure that the board has been received in good condition with no obvious signs of damage. Both the lower A and the upper B board of the ESP32-LyraTD-MSC should be firmly connected together.


Initial Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prepare the board for loading of the first sample application:

1. Connect 4-ohm speakers to the **Right** and **Left Speaker Output**. Connecting headphones to the **Headphone Output** is an option.
2. Plug in the Micro-USB cables to the PC and to **both USB ports** of the ESP32-LyraTD-MSC.
3. The **Standby LED** (green) should turn on. Assuming that a battery is not connected, the **Charging LED** (red) will blink every couple of seconds.
4. Toggle right the **Power Switch**.
5. The red **Power On LED** should turn on.

If this is what you see on the LEDs, the board should be ready for application upload. Now prepare the PC by loading and configuring development tools what is discussed in the next section.


Develop Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ESP32-LyraTD-MSC is initially set up and checked, you can proceed with preparation of the development tools. Go to section :doc:`index`, which will walk you through the following steps:

* :ref:`get-started-setup-esp-idf` in your PC that provides a common framework to develop applications for the ESP32 in C language;
* :ref:`get-started-get-esp-adf` to have the API specific for the audio applications;
* :ref:`get-started-setup-path` to make the framework aware of the audio specific API;
* :ref:`get-started-start-project` that will provide a sample audio application for the ESP32-LyraTD-MSC board;
* :ref:`get-started-connect-configure` to prepare the application for loading;
* :ref:`get-started-build-flash-monitor` this will finally run the application and play some music.
