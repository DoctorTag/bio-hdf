This document is intended to help users set up the software environment for the development of audio applications using hardware based on the ESP32 by Espressif. Through a simple example, we would like to illustrate how to use ESP-ADF (Espressif Audio Development Framework).

To make the start with ESP-ADF quicker, Espressif designed development boards intended to build audio applications with the ESP32. Click the links below to get started.

If you do not have one of the above boards, you can still use ESP-ADF for the ESP32 based audio applications. This is providing your board has a compatible audio codec or DSP chip, or you develop a driver to support communication with your specific chip.


About ESP-ADF
=============

The ESP-ADF is available as a set of :adf:`components` to extend the functionality already delivered by the `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_ (Espressif IoT Development Framework).

To use ESP-ADF you need set up the ESP-IDF first, and this is described in the next section.

.. note::

    ESP-ADF is developed using `v3.3.1 version of ESP-IDF <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/versions.html>`_. If your have already set up another version, please switch to the v3.3.1, or you may not be able to compile ESP-ADF applications.

.. _get-started-setup-esp-idf:

Set up ESP-IDF
==============

Configure your PC according to `ESP32 Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/>`_. `Windows <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/windows-setup.html>`_, `Linux <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/linux-setup.html>`_ and `Mac OS <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/macos-setup.html>`_ operating systems are supported.

You have a choice to compile and upload code to the ESP32 by command line with `make <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/make-project.html>`_ or using `Eclipse IDE <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/eclipse-setup.html>`_.

.. note::

    We are using ``~/esp`` directory to install the toolchain, ESP-IDF, ESP-ADF and sample applications. You can use a different directory, but need to adjust respective commands.

To make the installation easier and less prone to errors, use the ``~/esp`` default directory for the installation. Once you get through ESP-IDF setup and move to the ESP-ADF, you will notice that installation of the ESP-ADF follows the similar process. This should make it even easier to get up and running with the ESP-ADF.

If this is your first exposure to the ESP32 and `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_, then it is recommended to get familiar with :adf:`hello_world <esp-idf/examples/get-started/hello_world>` and :adf:`blink <esp-idf/examples/get-started/blink>` examples first. Once you can build, upload and run these two examples, then you are ready to proceed to the next section.


.. _get-started-get-esp-adf:

Get ESP-ADF
===========

.. highlight:: bash

Having the ESP-IDF to compile, build and upload application for ESP32, you can now move to installing audio specific API / libraries. They are provided in `ESP-ADF repository <https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf>`_. To get it, open terminal, navigate to the directory to put the ESP-ADF, and clone it using ``git clone`` command::

    cd ~/esp
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf.git

ESP-ADF will be downloaded into ``~/esp/esp-adf``.

.. note::

    Do not miss the ``--recursive`` option. If you have already cloned ESP-ADF without this option, run another command to get all the submodules::

        cd ~/esp/esp-adf
        git submodule update --init


.. _get-started-setup-path:

Setup Path to ESP-ADF
=====================

The toolchain programs access ESP-ADF using ``ADF_PATH`` environment variable. This variable should be set up on your PC, otherwise the projects will not build. The process to set it up is analogous to setting up the ``IDF_PATH`` variable, please see instructions in ESP-IDF documentation under `Add IDF_PATH to User Profile <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/add-idf_path-to-profile.html>`_.


.. _get-started-start-project:

Start a Project
===============

After initial preparation you are ready to build the first audio application for the ESP32. The process has already been described in ESP-IDF documentation. Now we would like to discuss again the key steps and show how the toolchain is able to access the ESP-ADF :adf:`components` by using the ``ADF_PATH`` variable.

.. note::

    ESP-ADF is based on a specific release of the ESP-IDF. You will see this release cloned with ESP-ADF as a subdirectory, or more specifically as a submodule e.g. ``esp-idf @ ca3faa61`` visible on the GitHub. Just follow this instruction and the build scripts will automatically reach ESP-IDF from the submodule.


To demonstrate how to build an application, we will use :example:`get-started/play_mp3` project from :adf:`examples` directory in the ADF.

Copy :example:`get-started/play_mp3` to ``~/esp`` directory::

    cd ~/esp
    cp -r $ADF_PATH/examples/get-started/play_mp3 .

You can also find a range of example projects under the :adf:`examples` directory in the ESP-ADF repository. These example project directories can be copied in the same way as presented above, to begin your own projects.


.. _get-started-connect-configure:

Connect and Configure
=====================

Connect the audio ESP32 board to the PC, check under what serial port the board is visible and verify, if serial communication works as described in `ESP-IDF Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.1/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html>`_.

At the terminal window, go to the directory of ``play_mp3`` application and configure it with ``menuconfig`` by selecting the serial port, upload speed and the audio board version::

    cd ~/esp/play_mp3
    make menuconfig

Save the configuration.


.. _get-started-build-flash-monitor:

Build, Flash and Monitor
========================

Now you can build, upload and check the application. Run::

    make flash monitor -j5

This will build the application including ESP-IDF / ESP-ADF components, upload (flash) binaries to your ESP32 board and start the monitor.

Upload
------

.. highlight:: none

To upload the binaries, the board should be put into upload mode. To do so, hold down **Boot** button, momentarily press **Reset** button and release the **Boot** button. The upload mode may be initiated anytime during the application build, but no later than "Connecting" message is being displayed::

    ...

    esptool.py v2.1
    Connecting........_____....

Without the upload mode enabled, after showing several ``....._____``, the connection will eventually time out.

Once build and upload is complete, you should see the following::

    ...

    Leaving...
    Hard resetting...
    MONITOR
    --- idf_monitor on /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 ---
    --- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---

Monitor
-------

At this point press the **Reset** button to start the application. Following several lines of start up log, the ``play_mp3`` application specific messages should be displayed::

    ...

    I (303) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [ 1 ] Start audio codec chip
    I (323) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [ 2 ] Create audio pipeline, add all elements to pipeline, and subscribe pipeline event
    I (323) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [2.1] Create mp3 decoder to decode mp3 file and set custom read callback
    I (333) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [2.2] Create i2s stream to write data to codec chip
    I (343) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [2.3] Register all elements to audio pipeline
    I (353) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [2.4] Link it together [mp3_music_read_cb]-->mp3_decoder-->i2s_stream-->[codec_chip]
    I (363) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [ 3 ] Setup event listener
    I (363) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [3.1] Listening event from all elements of pipeline
    I (373) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [ 4 ] Start audio_pipeline
    W (373) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [mp3] RESUME:Element has not running,state:3,task_run:1
    W (393) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [i2s] RESUME:Element has not running,state:3,task_run:1
    I (403) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [ * ] Receive music info from mp3 decoder, sample_rates=44100, bits=16, ch=2
    W (433) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [i2s] RESUME:Element has not running,state:3,task_run:1
    I (7183) PLAY_MP3_FLASH: [ 5 ] Stop audio_pipeline
    W (7183) AUDIO_PIPELINE: There are no listener registered

If there are no issues, besides the above log, you should hear a sound played for about 7 seconds by the speakers or headphones connected to your audio board. Reset the board to hear it again if required.

Now you are ready to try some other :adf:`examples`, or go right to developing your own applications. Check how the :adf:`examples` are made aware of location of the ESP-ADF. Open the :example_file:`get-started/play_mp3/Makefile` and you should see ::


    PROJECT_NAME := play_mp3
    include $(ADF_PATH)/project.mk

The second line contains ``$ADF_PATH`` to point the toolchain to the ESP-ADF. You need similar ``Makefile`` in your own applications developed with the ESP-ADF.


Update ESP-ADF
==============

After some time of using ESP-ADF, you may want to update it to take advantage of new features or bug fixes. The simplest way to do so is by deleting existing ``esp-adf`` folder and cloning it again, which is same as when doing initial installation described in sections :ref:`get-started-get-esp-adf`.

Another solution is to update only what has changed. This method is useful if you have a slow connection to the GitHub. To do the update run the following commands::

    cd ~/esp/esp-adf
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive

The ``git pull`` command is fetching and merging changes from ESP-ADF repository on GitHub. Then ``git submodule update --init --recursive`` is updating existing submodules or getting a fresh copy of new ones. On GitHub the submodules are represented as links to other repositories and require this additional command to get them onto your PC.
