This document is intended to help users set up the software environment for the development of healthcare applications using hardware based on the BioSensor-F58GM. Through a simple example, we would like to illustrate how to use BIO-HDF (BioSensor Healthcare Development Framework).

To make the start with BIO-HDF quicker, We designed development boards intended to build healthcare applications with the BioSensor. Click the links below to get started.

If you do not have one of the above boards, you can still use BIO-HDF for the BioSensor based healthcare applications. This is providing your board has a compatible MCU or DSP chip, or you develop a driver to support communication with your specific chip.For the porting of drivers and algorithms, you can apply for technical support by emailï¼šfanfeiwu@gmail.com.


About BIO-HDF
=============

The BIO-HDF is available as a set of :hdf:`components` to extend the functionality already delivered by the `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_ (Espressif IoT Development Framework).

To use BIO-HDF you need set up the ESP-IDF first, and this is described in the next section.

.. note::

    BIO-HDF is developed using `stable version of ESP-IDF <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/versions.html>`_. If your have already set up another version, please switch to the stable, or you may not be able to compile BIO-HDF applications.

.. _get-started-setup-esp-idf:

Set up ESP-IDF
==============

Configure your PC according to `ESP32 Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/>`_. `Windows <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/windows-setup.html>`_, `Linux <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/linux-setup.html>`_ and `Mac OS <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/macos-setup.html>`_ operating systems are supported.

You have a choice to compile and upload code to the ESP32 by command line with `make <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/make-project.html>`_ or using `Eclipse IDE <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/eclipse-setup.html>`_.

.. note::

    We are using ``~/esp`` directory to install the toolchain, ESP-IDF, BIO-HDF and sample applications. You can use a different directory, but need to adjust respective commands.

To make the installation easier and less prone to errors, use the ``~/esp`` default directory for the installation. Once you get through ESP-IDF setup and move to the BIO-HDF, you will notice that installation of the BIO-HDF follows the similar process. This should make it even easier to get up and running with the BIO-HDF.

If this is your first exposure to the ESP32 and `ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_, then it is recommended to get familiar with :adf:`hello_world <esp-idf/examples/get-started/hello_world>` and :adf:`blink <esp-idf/examples/get-started/blink>` examples first. Once you can build, upload and run these two examples, then you are ready to proceed to the next section.


.. _get-started-get-esp-hdf:

Get BIO-HDF
===========

.. highlight:: bash

Having the ESP-IDF to compile, build and upload application for ESP32, you can now move to installing healthcare specific API / libraries. They are provided in `BIO-HDF repository <https://github.com/feelkit/bio-hdf>`_. To get it, open terminal, navigate to the directory to put the BIO-HDF, and clone it using ``git clone`` command::

    cd ~/esp
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/feelkit/bio-hdf.git

BIO-HDF will be downloaded into ``~/esp/bio-hdf``.

.. note::

    Do not miss the ``--recursive`` option. If you have already cloned BIO-HDF without this option, run another command to get all the submodules::

        cd ~/esp/bio-hdf
        git submodule update --init


.. _get-started-setup-path:

Setup Path to BIO-HDF
=====================

The toolchain programs access BIO-HDF using ``HDF_PATH`` environment variable. This variable should be set up on your PC, otherwise the projects will not build. The process to set it up is analogous to setting up the ``IDF_PATH`` variable, please see instructions in ESP-IDF documentation under `Add IDF_PATH to User Profile <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/add-idf_path-to-profile.html>`_.


.. _get-started-start-project:

Start a Project
===============

After initial preparation you are ready to build the first healthcare application for the BioSensor. The process has already been described in ESP-IDF documentation. Now we would like to discuss again the key steps and show how the toolchain is able to access the BIO-HDF :hdf:`components` by using the ``HDF_PATH`` variable.

.. note::

    BIO-HDF is based on a specific release of the ESP-IDF. You will see this release cloned with BIO-HDF as a subdirectory, or more specifically as a submodule e.g. ``esp-idf @ ca3faa61`` visible on the GitHub. Just follow this instruction and the build scripts will automatically reach ESP-IDF from the submodule.


To demonstrate how to build an application, we will use :example:`get-started/health_piezo` project from :hdf:`examples` directory in the ADF.

Copy :example:`get-started/health_piezo` to ``~/esp`` directory::

    cd ~/esp
    cp -r $HDF_PATH/examples/get-started/health_piezo .

You can also find a range of example projects under the :adf:`examples` directory in the BIO-HDF repository. These example project directories can be copied in the same way as presented above, to begin your own projects.


.. _get-started-connect-configure:

Connect and Configure
=====================

Connect the healthcare ESP32 board to the PC, check under what serial port the board is visible and verify, if serial communication works as described in `ESP-IDF Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html>`_.

At the terminal window, go to the directory of ``health_piezo`` application and configure it with ``menuconfig`` by selecting the serial port, upload speed and the healthcare board version::

    cd ~/esp/health_piezo
    idf.py menuconfig

Save the configuration.


.. _get-started-build-flash-monitor:

Build, Flash and Monitor
========================

Now you can build, upload and check the application. Run::

    idf.py flash 

This will build the application including ESP-IDF / BIO-HDF components, upload (flash) binaries to your ESP32 board and start the monitor.

Upload
------

.. highlight:: none

To upload the binaries, the board should be put into upload mode. To do so, hold down **Reset** button. The upload mode may be initiated anytime during the application build, but no later than "Connecting" message is being displayed::

    ...

    esptool.py v2.1
    Connecting........_____....

Without the upload mode enabled, after showing several ``....._____``, the connection will eventually time out.

Once build and upload is complete, you should see the following::

    ...

    Leaving...
    Hard resetting...
    MONITOR
    --- idf_monitor on /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 ---
    --- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---

Monitor
-------

Power on again to start the application. Following several lines of start up log, the ``health_piezo`` application specific messages should be displayed::

    ...

    I (1519) FeelKit_HUart: health_hw_uart_init  
       ...

    I (1699) FeelKit_TCP: Waiting for AP connection...
    I (1699) FeelKit_TCP: SYSTEM_EVENT_STA_START
    I (1709) FeelKit_Comm: The hal has been initialized!
    I (1709) BTDM_INIT: BT controller compile version [fd2a63b]
    I (1719) system_api: Base MAC address is not set, read default base MAC address from BLK0 of EFUSE
    I (1979) FeelKit_BLE: health_ble_init init bluetooth
    I (2069) FeelKit_BLE: EVT 0, gatts if 3
    I (2069) FeelKit_BLE: event = 0
    I (2069) FeelKit_BLE: gatts_profile_event_handler 385
    I (2079) FeelKit_BLE: gatts_profile_event_handler 388
    I (2079) FeelKit_BLE: gatts_profile_event_handler 391
    I (2089) FeelKit_Comm: The hal has been initialized!
    I (2159) FeelKit_Stream: sensor_status = 0x0
       ...


If there are no issues, besides the above log, you should find:"FeelKit_Stream: sensor_status = 0x0". if sensor_status != 0x0,then it is error.

Now you are ready to try some other :hdf:`examples`, or go right to developing your own applications. Check how the :hdf:`examples` are made aware of location of the BIO-HDF. Open the :example_file:`get-started/health_piezo/CMakeLists` and you should see ::

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
    include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)
    include($ENV{HDF_PATH}/CMakeLists.txt)
    project(health_piezo)

The third line contains ``$HDF_PATH`` to point the toolchain to the BIO-HDF. You need similar ``CMakeLists`` in your own applications developed with the BIO-HDF.


Update BIO-HDF
==============

After some time of using BIO-HDF, you may want to update it to take advantage of new features or bug fixes. The simplest way to do so is by deleting existing ``bio-hdf`` folder and cloning it again, which is same as when doing initial installation described in sections :ref:`get-started-get-bio-hdf`.

Another solution is to update only what has changed. This method is useful if you have a slow connection to the GitHub. To do the update run the following commands::

    cd ~/esp/bio-hdf
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive

The ``git pull`` command is fetching and merging changes from BIO-HDF repository on GitHub. Then ``git submodule update --init --recursive`` is updating existing submodules or getting a fresh copy of new ones. On GitHub the submodules are represented as links to other repositories and require this additional command to get them onto your PC.
