Overview
^^^^^^^^

The ESP32-LyraT V4.3 is an audio development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_ built around ESP32. It is intended for audio applications, by providing hardware for audio processing and additional RAM on top of what is already onboard of the ESP32 chip. The specific hardware includes:

* **ESP32-WROVER Module**
* **Audio Codec Chip**
* Dual **Microphones** on board
* **Headphone** input
* **2 x 3-watt Speaker** output
* Dual **Auxiliary Input**
* **MicroSD Card** slot (1 line or 4 lines)
* **Six buttons** (2 physical buttons and 4 touch buttons)
* **JTAG** header
* Integrated **USB-UART Bridge Chip**
* Li-ion **Battery-Charge Management**

The block diagram below presents main components of the ESP32-LyraT and interconnections between components.

Components
^^^^^^^^^^

The following list and figure describe key components, interfaces and controls of the ESP32-LyraT used in this guide. This covers just what is needed now. For detailed technical documentation of this board, please refer to :doc:`../design-guide/board-esp32-lyrat-v4.3` and `ESP32 LyraT V4.3 schematic`_ (PDF).


ESP32-WROVER Module
    The ESP32-WROVER module contains ESP32 chip to provide Wi-Fi / BT connectivity and data processing power as well as integrates 32 Mbit SPI flash and 32 Mbit PSRAM for flexible data storage.
Headphone Output
    Output socket to connect headphones with a 3.5 mm stereo jack.

    .. note::

        The socket may be used with mobile phone headsets and is compatible with OMPT standard headsets only. It does work with CTIA headsets. Please refer to `Phone connector (audio) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#TRRS_standards>`_ on Wikipedia.

    ESP32-LyraT V4.3 Board Layout Overview

Left Speaker Output
    Output socket to connect 4 ohm speaker. The pins have a standard 2.54 mm / 0.1" pitch.
Right Speaker Output
    Output socket to connect 4 ohm speaker. The pins have a standard 2.54 mm / 0.1" pitch.
Boot/Reset Press Keys
    Boot: holding down the **Boot** button and momentarily pressing the **Reset** button initiates the firmware upload mode. Then user can upload firmware through the serial port. Reset: pressing this button alone resets the system.
Audio Codec Chip
    The Audio Codec Chip, `ES8388 <http://www.everest-semi.com/pdf/ES8388%20DS.pdf>`_, is a low power stereo audio codec with a headphone amplifier. It consists of 2-channel ADC, 2-channel DAC, microphone amplifier, headphone amplifier, digital sound effects, analog mixing and gain functions. It is interfaced with **ESP32-WROVER Module** over I2S and I2S buses to provide audio processing in hardware independently from the audio application.
USB-UART Port
    Functions as the communication interface between a PC and the ESP32 WROVER module.
USB Power Port
    Provides the power supply for the board.
Standby / Charging LEDs
    The **Standby** green LED indicates that power has been applied to the **Micro USB Port**. The **Charging** red LED indicates that a battery connected to the **Battery Socket** is being charged.
Power Switch
    Power on/off knob: toggling it to the left powers the board on; toggling it to the right powers the board off.
Power On LED
    Red LED indicating that **Power On Switch** is turned on.


Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up the ESP32-LyraT, please make sure that the board has been received in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.


Initial Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prepare the board for loading of the first sample application:

1. Connect 4-ohm speakers to the **Right** and **Left Speaker Output**. Connecting headphones to the **Headphone Output** is an option.
2. Plug in the Micro-USB cables to the PC and to **both USB ports** of the ESP32 LyraT.
3. The **Standby LED** (green) should turn on. Assuming that a battery is not connected, the **Charging LED** (red) will blink every couple of seconds.
4. Toggle left the **Power On Switch**.
5. The red **Power On LED** should turn on.

If this is what you see on the LEDs, the board should be ready for application upload. Now prepare the PC by loading and configuring development tools what is discussed in the next section.


Develop Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ESP32 LyraT is initially set up and checked, you can proceed with preparation of the development tools. Go to section :doc:`index`, which will walk you through the following steps:

* :ref:`get-started-setup-esp-idf` in your PC that provides a common framework to develop applications for the ESP32 in C language;
* :ref:`get-started-get-esp-adf` to have the API specific for the audio applications;
* :ref:`get-started-setup-path` to make the framework aware of the audio specific API;
* :ref:`get-started-start-project` that will provide a sample audio application for the ESP32-LyraT board;
* :ref:`get-started-connect-configure` to prepare the application for loading;
* :ref:`get-started-build-flash-monitor` this will finally run the application and play some music.


Summary of Key Changes from LyraT V4.2
