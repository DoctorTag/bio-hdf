Services
********

To interface an ESP32 based audio device with external physical or virtual devices, like a Bluetooth speaker or a cloud server, the ADF provides services. A service is a software implementation of specific protocol to facilitate communication between devices. Usually it also covers a set of functionalities to execute specific operations that involve either one or both devices, e.g. muting a Bluetooth speaker during playback or recognizing voice commands to adjust the color temperature of light in a room. The service may also provide polices to allow device operation by specific user or application.
