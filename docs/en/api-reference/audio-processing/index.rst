Audio Processing
****************

There are couple of options implemented in the ESP-ADF to modify contents of an audio stream:

* Combine contents of two audio streams using :doc:`downmix`
* Apply ten band :doc:`equalizer`
* Change audio sampling frequency and convert between single and two channel with :doc:`filter_resample`
* Modify pitch and speed of the stream using :doc:`audio_sonic`

Please refer to description of respective APIs below.
